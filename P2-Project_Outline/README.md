# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Kansas City Pet Project (KCPP), the third largest no-kill animal shelter in the country, is currently partnered with the Petco Foundation. Part of this partnership allows for the shelter to house adoptable cats inside the various Petco stores across the Kansas City metro. Adopters can visit these different KCPP satellite locations and meet or adopt their new feline friend. However, these adoptions are currently done on paper with the handwritten information being passed along to KCPP. This information includes the adoption contract, the adopter's personal information, and the cat's identifying information. This project would aim to streamline this adoption paperwork process by eliminating the hand written contracts and improving inefficiencies around sending this data to KCPP for completion. 

The app will host a DocuSign contract that will have all the essential information needed to process the adoption. Additionally, the app will collect the users personal information as well as the cat's identifying information. It will store all of this information in a database which will be used to help ease the process for KCPP staff when finalizing adoptions. Lastly, the app will send the adopter an email thanking them for the adoption as well as any supplementary material that KCPP provides with these adoptions.

This idea is collaboration between my wife and I. My wife, Danielle, currently works as the manager for the KCPP Petco Habitats and this has been something we have been discussing for a few months. 


### Features
- User Login/Authentication: The user will sign in via Google OAuth. The user will be the person hosting the adoption at one of the offsite satellite locations
- Information Input: The user will enter the adopter's personal information as well as the cat's indentifying information
- Contract Signing: The contract will be hosted by a DocuSign API - this will be signed by the adopter and overseen by the app's user
- Email Confirmation: An email will be sent to the adopter that confirms the adoption and includes supplementary material provided by KCPP

### What I'll Have to Learn
I already have experience with React, Node.js, Passport.js, and Heroku. I will be actively learning Express.js and MongoDB to handle the server side of the application.
